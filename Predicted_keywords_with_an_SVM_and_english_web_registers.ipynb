Jovanovski return to the Panthers this year and he can see the similarity between both team , even though he be more concerned these day with deal with New Jersey in the eastern conference quarterfinal . \" there be countless people who think we be suppose to be do right now , \" Jovanovski say . \" I guess you can say the same on the '96 team . no one really give we a chance . I kind of like be in that role . it be what it be . we know what we can do in here if we be play well . that be all that matter be trust in you teammate and know you have that ability to get it do . for we group , that be what we rely on , each other . \" Jovanovski be but one link this year 's panther have to that 1996 team that make a magical playoff run through the eastern conference playoff , beat Boston , Philadelphia and Pittsburgh before be sweep by Colorado in the Stanley cup final . Gord Murphy , a defenseman on the 1996 team , be a assistant on Dineen 's coaching staff ; Brian Skrudland , the captain of the 1996 team , be now the team 's director of player development ; and Bill Lindsay , a forward on the 1996 team , be now the team 's television analyst . when Murphy and Skrudland both be hire in July of 2010 , Tallon say , \" we want to bring back the sense of family , the sense of history and tradition from earlier panther day . \" Lindsay score the most famous goal in franchise history when he skate around hall of fame defenseman Ray Bourque and beat Bill Ranford while fall to the ice for the game - winner in the panther 's game 5 first - round series clincher against the Bruins in 1996 . a picture of that goal have be hang at BankAtlantic Center in the Panthers 's Den of honor , which be unveil in March of 2010 . this year 's team also figure to have a place in the den of honor before too long , and Lindsay be hope the 2012 panther can have a long postseason run of they own . \" you can draw a lot of parallel between those two team , \" Lindsay say . \" we will have to see how it play out . but it be be a long time . I be incredibly happy for this group and what they have be able to do and move forward . hopefully they can get some of they own memory and start the tip of this iceberg go the right way and hopefully this be just the sign of many good year to come . \" both team really have no star . it be a group that be go to have to get it do as a team . it be go to be that four line , six defenseman . that be what we have in ' 96 . I think the similarity from that standpoint be very alike . they have some talent , but they be go to have to get it do as a group . they have work hard all season long , that be the only way to get there and that be the way we do it in ' 96 . \" Murphy , for he part , do not care to start compare the two team . \" this group be its own group , \" Murphy say . \" it be get its own story line , it be get its own blend of player , talent , leadership , personality . obviously , it be nice to do that and look back and that be a heck of a team and a heck of a run , but these guy deserve the recognition for what they have achieve and what they be do . I do not try and put too much kind of comparison and similarity into it . \" for a team with such a limited playoff history as the panther , it be almost inevitable to look back . but there be one big difference between the two team , one that should encourage the panther and they fan . even while they be make they run in 1996 , the panther never look like a team that be start something big . there be reason to believe that be the case with this year 's panther . Tallon build this team for the future , stockpil the organization with high - end prospects like first - round pick Jonathan Huberdeau , Quinton Howden , Nick Bjugstad and Gudbranson . Gudbranson make a major contribution this season , but he figure to only get better and the other should start join he in the nhl in the next couple of season . \" that be what be really exciting for I be the fun begin now , \" Tallon say . \" move forward we do not disrupt we future to get success early here in the present . we have a bright future ahead of we . now we can keep add piece to this core that be really a good strong core now . so we be in good shape as far as the organization be concerned . \"\n",

[ cry . ] of course , we have not have a game 7 of the world series since 2002 , and it kinda look like we be in for one of those too . Jason Motte , the fireballing former catcher who might have be bear with a beard , really only throw one bad pitch last night , a cutter that catch too much of the plate and be rip by Elvis Andrus for a single in the ninth inning . this be right after a bloop hit by Ian Kinsler , and right before a error by Albert Pujols send Andrus to second . before you know it , the Cardinals have go from three out away from a 2- 0 world series lead to a near - impossible situation : runner on second and third , no out , and the meat of the ranger 's order come up . we agree with those who say Tony La Russa , whose hot streak finally cool last night , probably should have leave in motte to face Josh Hamilton ; more than anything , the Cardinals need a strikeout , and they be far more likely to get that from Motte , no matter how rattle he might have be , than from Arthur Rhodes , whose fastball could not dent a buick . but it be not as if Rhodes and Lance Lynn , who come in after Rhodes give up a sac fly to Hamilton , be light up . they each give up sacrifice flies , and that be all the ranger need . by the time La Russa make the switch from motte , the damage be do . the real problem be not the bullpen , as much as it feel like it this morning . ( for the record , it also feel like my brain be engulf in flame this morning , as I type . October baseball , with the late night and the screaming and the alcohol that come with it , be hazardous to vital organ . ) the problem be the fact that the Cardinals could not hit . Jaime Garcia throw seven brilliant shutout inning , but the Cardinals could not get he more than one run against Colby Lewis , a solid but hittable pitcher . Albert Pujols do not stay and answer question after the game -- a practice that annoy media people and only media people ; no one else care , at all -- but he 0 - for - 4 night be not the only Cardinals issue . Pujols , Lance Berkman , Matt Holliday , and Yadier Molina , the Cardinals 's four all - star hitter , go a combine 1 - for - 13 last night . the only run score thanks to another pinch hit by Allen Craig off Alexi Ogando ; you will be see a ton of Craig when the series get to the American League tomorrow . but the Cardinals can not expect to win with those four guy go 1 - for - 13 . that be what cost the Cardinals last night . Motte just catch some bad luck ... and throw one bad pitch . if you have be enjoy these tight , taut , quick , low - scoring game , that enjoyment be about to end . the series head to the launching pad -- such a great baseball term , \" launching pad \" -- and feature some league - average starter face some of the best hitter in baseball . the level of offense in this series be about to increase exponentially . as be the level of tension . the series , so close to a 2- 0 cardinal lead , be tie , and it be go to be a damned opera every freaking night for the next week . we be in for a all - timer here , folk . it be not go to be easy for anybody . gird you liver .\n",

            "sr\tthe wave of young quarterback and the effect of experience on performance the wave of the young signal caller be upon we . this year there be five rookie and five second - year quarterback start from opening day . over the past ten season there have never be a year in which this many first and second - year quarterback start the majority of game for they respective team . the high number of inexperienced start quarterback get we think : be the league in a flux with so many team look to rebuild , or do experience not matter to quarterback play ? to answer this question , we want to determine how experience affect quarterback performance . if season of experience be not a significant predictor of quarterback play , then perhaps even team in contention for a playoff spot be justify in start a inexperienced quarterback . to measure performance , I collect data on expect point add per play ( EPA / p ) from the past ten season for quarterback who start a majority of they team 's game . in addition to EPA / p , I record the player 's year of experience , age , and if and where the player be draft as well . after collect the data , I run a regression use a 95 % confidence level to determine if experience , quarterback age , and when and if the player be draft be a significant predictor of quarterback performance as measure by EPA / p . here be the result : experience , age , and if the player be draft all have a significant effect on player performance . control for the include variable , a additional year of experience increase epa/p by about 0.02 . the inclusion of age be especially important , as we be focus on the effect of experience on production . have age in we regression allow we to compare how much better we would expect a 7 - year veteran and 28 - year - old quarterback , like Aaron Rodgers or Alex Smith , compare to a rookie 28 - year - old quarterback , like Brandon Weeden . surprisingly when the player be draft do not have a significant effect on performance . there be two potential explanation as to why draft position do not have a significant impact on player performance . one reason be the high bust rate at the quarterback position . player such as JaMarcus Russell and Tim Couch , both take with the first overall pick in they respective draft , be classic example of player fail to perform to the level of they draft position . the second reason be the play of quarterback such as Tom Brady and Marc Bulger , who consistently perform at a top level despite be take with 6 th round pick . as the data show , experience do have a significant effect on quarterback performance , suggest the league be indeed in a flux with a high number of team look to rebuild . these team be insert inexperienced quarterback even though more experienced quarterback perform significantly better . perhaps we will see these young signal caller take the league by storm and thrive despite they lack of experience ; however base on the past ten season though such expectation should be temper . almost a third of league be start quarterback with a year or less of experience while these team may be rebuild now , we might see they rise to prominence in a few year behind they more experienced quarterback . 3 response to the wave of young quarterback and the effect of experience on performance the one thing I might suggest be some kind of era/ season adjustment . over the last few year passers have have higher and higher level of production . on the other hand , that create a chicken - egg problem : be rookie qb do better because pass be easier , or do pass appear easier because we have so many talented qb currently in the league ? ps the explanation for why draft order do not correlate with performance be due to selection / survival effect in the population . one other thing while it be on my mind . age be important but it be not uniformly linear . in the early year it will have a positive slope and in the later year of a career it will have a negative slope . but again , there will be a survival effect where only the very best qb 'survive ' to play into they mid /late 30 , mask the true rate of decline due to age . do not look at player who start the majority of season - team game lead to a survivorship bias where you would expect experience to have a positive effect because the worst inexperienced qb would be replace before be bad experience qb ? the reason why I only include quarterback who start the majority of they team 's game be to eliminate small sample size bias . for example I do not want to include Tom Brady 's 2008 season where he only play 1 quarter .\n",
